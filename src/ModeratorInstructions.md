# Moderator Instructions

This page gives instructions to the moderator, the one who is responsible
for coordinating one or more instances of the Classroom Mob Programming Game.

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that students already have facility with a programming language,
a development environment, and the fundamental techniques of Test-Driven
Development.

The game is designed for teams of 4&ndash;6 players. You can play with larger
groups, but it means you will have fewer iterations through the team. 

## Before the Game

Review all the rules so that you are comfortable with them
and can moderate the experience.

Print up enough of the [role handouts](handout.pdf) so that you will have
one of each per player. Fold these into quarters so that only one level
is visible at a time. Note that the point of quartering the paper is so
that new players are not overwhelmed with the amount of information
they are given; you could have your players do the folding to distribute
the manual effort instead.

Determine if you want to pick the teams, if you want the teams to pick
themselves, or if you want them to be randomzied.

Determine how many rounds you want to complete.
It is recommended to complete at least two rounds so that teams
have an opportunity to reflect on their first one and incorporate
improvements into their second one.

## Setting Up

Divide your group into appropriately-sized teams and, if possible, arrange
the physical space so that each team has a clear workspace that includes
table space, moveable chairs, and whiteboards.

Instruct teach team to select one laptop to use for the work session
and to remove all others from the environment. It is convenient here to also
provide USB keyboards and mice along with hand sanitizer.

Have each team write a list of the members' names. This is the list
through which the roles of Navigator, Driver, and Mobber will move.
It is recommended that the names be shuffled so that the sequence
is random; this can be done with a Web service such as
[random.org's list randomizer](https://www.random.org/lists/).
Mark the first person on the list as the Driver and the second
one as the Navigator.

Give each team a description of the problem that is being solved
through the session. This can be done with a handout or by posting it
in an easily viewable place such as a projection screen or whiteboard.
[FizzBuzz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz) is recommended
for novice teams.
Depending on the experience level of the teams, you might want to
provide a project skeleton that includes an initial failing unit test.

It is easy for students to become overwhelmed and forget the goal
of the game, no matter how often you say it. Therefore, you should
write, project, or provide handouts to frame the exercise, using
text like this:
> Use Test-Driven Development and Mob Programming to solve the following
> programming challenge: [Insert the programming challenge here]

Prepare a timer that you can run for all players, and project this
to the room if possible. Three-minute turns are recommended,
and a single round of the game should have as many turns as there
are players in the largest team. This way, each player will have
a chance to take a turn as each role at least once.

## Getting Started

Distribute the role sheets and explain the rules of the game:

1. The goal of each team is to use Mob Programming to make as much
progress as they can on the problem.

1. Within a team, at any time, there will be one Driver and one Navigator
and the rest will be Mobbers. When the timer goes off, the roles process
to the next players in the list: the previous Navigator becomes a Mobber,
the previous Driver becomes the Navigator, and the next Mobber in sequence
becomes the new Driver.

1. You earn Experience Points (XP) in each role by taking actions
that are appropriate to that role. When you have taken an action
on your current role sheet, you must announce this to your team,
and then you can mark one of the XP boxes.

1. When you have marked all the boxes on one role sheet, you level up:
flip your role card to the next higher level, which will change what
actions you have available. At the highest level, every XP earns
bonus points.

1. After the determined number of turns, the round will be over.

## Running the Game

Give the signal for each team to begin playing and start the timer.
When the timer goes off, remind the teams to process the roles down
their lists. Mark down how many turns are remaining in the current round.

Between rounds, run a brief retrospective
meeting with the teams. Depending on the number of players you have,
this might be distributed to each team, but it is recommended to
do it collectively so that teams can learn from each other.
There is not a single best way to run the retrospective, but depending
on your observations, you might start with questions like these:

- What did you notice about the coding challenge or overall gameplay?
- Is there anything you are struggling with?

## Ending the Game

A team's score is equal to ten times the total levels that were earned (plus
bonus points for extra Level 3 XP as described on the cards) divided by the size
of the team. Congratulate the team with the highest score. It is not recommended
to attach any course credit to this victory, but giving this team a token prize
can be fun for everyone.


Conduct another retrospective with the teams. This can use the same
questions as those suggested above, but this is also a good time for
you to point out what you noticed about their behavior as well.
Give each team an opportunity to share their findings if possible.
