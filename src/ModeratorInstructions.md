# Moderator Instructions

This page gives instructions to the moderator, the one who is responsible
for coordinating one or more instances of the Classroom Mob Programming Game.

## Prerequisites

It is assumed that students already have facility with a programming language,
a development environment, and the fundamental techniques of Test-Driven
Development.

The game is designed for teams of 4&ndash;6 players. You can play with larger
groups, but it means you will have fewer iterations through the team. 

## Setting Up

Divide your group into appropriately-sized teams and, if possible, arrange
the physical space so that each team has a clear workspace that includes
table space, moveable chairs, and whiteboards.

Instruct teach team to select one laptop to use for the work session
and to remove all others from the environment. It is convenient here to also
provide USB keyboards and mice along with hand sanitizer.
